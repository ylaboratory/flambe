# Source code

This directory includes most of the source code for the projects (e.g., loading and processing data, methods, evaluations, figure generation).

 Make sure the code does not use absolute paths specific to your machine, and comment code + update documentation! Read through the lab guidelines on quality code / code review or any of the many resources available online if you need any other guidance on coding practices.
